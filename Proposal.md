It’s hard enough to get good grades, but it becomes even harder when you are trying to balance school, family life, friends, and aspiring to be kickass brogrammers! </p><p>The only way to stay sane throughout all of this is to stay as organized as possible and to understand the value of time. There are countless organizational applications that already exist, but none of them have the right feel.  Trello, Wunderlist, Sunrise, Todoist,  and Calendars,  are all examples of  organizers that have  awesome features, but seem to be lacking in customization. </p><p>Our team of super cool brogrammers found time in between trips to the gym and protein shakes to solve the problems we’ve seen with these organizers and come up with a better solution.  We are planning to implement our solution in the form of our own organizational app, Planit! (prospective url: <a href="http://www.plan.it">http://www.plan.it</a>).</p><h2 id="outline"><a name="outline" href="#outline"></a>Outline</h2><p>Planit is a perfectly customizable organizer that makes every user feel like it was made specifically for them! Whether you are a busy stockbroker, a swamped college student, or a stay at home mom, Planit will be a perfect fit for you! </p><p>Planit gives you the options to make your methods of organizing as simple or complex as you like. We do this through modular planning! Every form of organization you could desire will be created into a module, where it can sync and run with other modules or run completely alone. Modules will consist of date trackers, reminders, grade calculators, and so much more. </p><p>The only thing that limits the type of modules that can exist is your imagination. Take your organizer into your own hands, and use Planit!</p><h2 id="preliminary-research"><a name="preliminary-research" href="#preliminary-research"></a>Preliminary Research</h2><p>...</p>
