# Project Overview

The project that team brogrammers wish to create is an organizer based on
independent modules. The main appeal of this is that it offers a lot of 
flexibility to the user. The user can organize themselves in as simple or
complex a fashion as they like. The orgainzer will be easy to use and
intuitive by nature.

# Original Proposal

For the proposal, our team met up last week and designed the entire thing.
We sat down and outlined the proposal. The proposal consists of a timeline,
a meet the team section, a problem statement, a description of the 
application, and some preliminary research.

Proposal.md, Proposal.pdf, notes.md are all documents that should be reviewed.
Proposal.md is our proposal, Proposal.pdf is our slide show, and notes.md is
our team notes.

#Functional Specification

Inside our notes folder we added two new documents 3-01-15 and 3-11-15 which
highlight our meetings and the jobs assigned to each person in the group. Inside
our docs/fspec folder we added individual documents for each section but the
documents you should review are called FunctionalSpecification.pdf and
FunctionalSpecificationSlides.pdf.

#Design Specification

Inside our notes folder we added two new documents 4-07-15 and 4-09-15 which
highlight our meeting and the tasks we need to complete. Inside docs/dspec
we added dspec.pdf and slides.pdf which are the files you should review for
this assignment. We believe our organization makes sense because not only did
Professor Richards agree with the layout, but many of the resources (including
Mean Machine by scotch.io)  that we used to assist in our understanding of these
components layed it out in a similar fashion. In addition, we followed the document 
specification/layout exactly by including an external libraies, birds eyeview, and component
breakdown sections. In each section we tied it to each other section, so that you would
know how each section interacted with each other.
