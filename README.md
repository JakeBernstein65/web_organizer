# Project Overview

The project that team brogrammers wish to create is an organizer based on
independent modules. The main appeal of this is that it offers a lot of 
flexibility to the user. The user can organize themselves in as simple or
complex a fashion as they like. The orgainzer will be easy to use and
intuitive by nature.

# Original Proposal

For the proposal, our team met up last week and designed the entire thing.
We sat down and outlined the proposal. The proposal consists of a timeline,
a meet the team section, a problem statement, a description of the 
application, and some preliminary research.

Proposal.md, Proposal.pdf, notes.md are all documents that should be reviewed.
Proposal.md is our proposal, Proposal.pdf is our slide show, and notes.md is
our team notes.
