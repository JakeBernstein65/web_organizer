John is a computer science major at some prestigious school. He's a genius in the making, but his scores
never really shows that. Due to his poor organizing, time management skills, and possibly memory he usually
forgets to complete assignments or finished but completely forgot about handing it in. John realizes that if
he wanted to show his genius and start doing better than decent he needed something to organize himself.
John signs up for PlannIt, and creates a planner just for his classes. 
It keeps track of important due dates, meetings, and if he totally forgot about an assignment PlannIt will
notify John in real time that a due date is coming up. No more forgetting about an assignment or forgetting
to hand it in for John or at least the excuse of forgetting.
