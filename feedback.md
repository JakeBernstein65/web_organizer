Project One: Profile

Overview: I’m interesting in seeing what direction this webapp will go. For each individual section you should include the author of it at the end, as well as a revision history that you will be editing throughout the semester. Very creative and appealing logo.  Creativity will be very helpful and will only help you, so don’t be afraid to keep being creative like you were with your logo. 

Idea: After reading your idea, I am not sure what the goal of your webapp is. In what ways will people use this app to improve their life? You could have elaborated a little more than two sentences on the overview to develop your overall idea a little more. Seems like you guys have a good general purpose of your app and once the idea gets developed more, you will be off to a good start!

Bios: You all could have added one of two more sentences to give a little more background on who you are besides a CS major, as well as a sentence about why you each chose the non-cs course that you did. Lucas did not include two additional non-cs courses. Be sure to all keep up and fully understand the workshops, as they will really help with your coding since no one mentioned any previous CSS/HTML or Javascript knowledge. 

Overall Grade: weak thumbs up

You should still keep the bios about your team members that you had for project one. Your problem statement does not reflect your classes and your timeline can be a little more specific. Add what exactly you hope to have accomplished or implemented by each date not just Build. Your budget breakdown is very thorough. Good job with that. Each section needs to have the author after it. For example who wrote the problem statement and when was it written? 

Your idea seems like it will be very useful to many people. I'm interested to see how this will turn out.  I like the whole idea behind your startup company since organization and planning seems to be an area that everyone struggles with, especially with such busy lives. Will everyone have a login name? Since people do not always have a computer near them and usually always have their smart phone with them, will this be an app for phones or a website? Think about any competitors and what will set you apart. 

Overall: weak thumbs up
