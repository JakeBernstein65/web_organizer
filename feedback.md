Project One: Profile

Overview: I’m interesting in seeing what direction this webapp will go. For each individual section you should include the author of it at the end, as well as a revision history that you will be editing throughout the semester. Very creative and appealing logo.  Creativity will be very helpful and will only help you, so don’t be afraid to keep being creative like you were with your logo. 

Idea: After reading your idea, I am not sure what the goal of your webapp is. In what ways will people use this app to improve their life? You could have elaborated a little more than two sentences on the overview to develop your overall idea a little more. Seems like you guys have a good general purpose of your app and once the idea gets developed more, you will be off to a good start!

Bios: You all could have added one of two more sentences to give a little more background on who you are besides a CS major, as well as a sentence about why you each chose the non-cs course that you did. Lucas did not include two additional non-cs courses. Be sure to all keep up and fully understand the workshops, as they will really help with your coding since no one mentioned any previous CSS/HTML or Javascript knowledge. 

Overall Grade: weak thumbs up

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Two:

You should still keep the bios about your team members that you had for project one. Your problem statement does not reflect your classes and your timeline can be a little more specific. Add what exactly you hope to have accomplished or implemented by each date not just Build. Your budget breakdown is very thorough. Good job with that. Each section needs to have the author after it. For example who wrote the problem statement and when was it written? 

Your idea seems like it will be very useful to many people. I'm interested to see how this will turn out.  I like the whole idea behind your startup company since organization and planning seems to be an area that everyone struggles with, especially with such busy lives. Will everyone have a login name? Since people do not always have a computer near them and usually always have their smart phone with them, will this be an app for phones or a website? Think about any competitors and what will set you apart. 

Overall: weak thumbs up. If you make these changes by 3/10, you will get a thumbs up.

Project Three:

Your scenarios could go more into detail on what exactly they are doing to complete the tasks described. For example, what function of Plannit does Emily use to not worry about forgetting to buy a certain item? The scenarios should have let me know about the different functions that Plannit has and not just when someone would use it. What is the difference between Plannit and any other online planner? What can Plannit do for me that no other site or planner can because right now it seems like there are many apps and websites that do the same thing. The iPhone app is a calendar that notifies me of upcoming events, stores and notifies me of details, etc. So why would I use Plannit instead? Do you have to be logged into the site in order for you to get a notification? What if you're on your computer but you don't happen to check your calendar the day of an event? What are the different layouts of the planner and in what cases would someone need a specific layout verse having one default layout? Why is no default planner layout such an important part of your concept?

Remember that your website should be aesthetically pleasing. Sometimes, dark backgrounds are not as inviting as lighter colored or white ones.

You did not include a revision history. This should track any changes you have or will make to your idea. Including any company name changes, layout changes, additional functionality, etc. 

Before your team goes further into the technical aspects of the development, think about your idea more. How exactly will Plannit be different from other planner sites? Think of at least two major applications of Plannit that will make people prefer it over any other planner and incorporate them into your idea.

Grade: Thumbs down. If you make these changes by April 2, you will receive a thumbs up.
