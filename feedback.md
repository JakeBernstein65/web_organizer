Project One: Profile

Overview: I’m interesting in seeing what direction this webapp will go. For each individual section you should include the author of it at the end, as well as a revision history that you will be editing throughout the semester. Very creative and appealing logo.  Creativity will be very helpful and will only help you, so don’t be afraid to keep being creative like you were with your logo. 

Idea: After reading your idea, I am not sure what the goal of your webapp is. In what ways will people use this app to improve their life? You could have elaborated a little more than two sentences on the overview to develop your overall idea a little more. Seems like you guys have a good general purpose of your app and once the idea gets developed more, you will be off to a good start!

Bios: You all could have added one of two more sentences to give a little more background on who you are besides a CS major, as well as a sentence about why you each chose the non-cs course that you did. Lucas did not include two additional non-cs courses. Be sure to all keep up and fully understand the workshops, as they will really help with your coding since no one mentioned any previous CSS/HTML or Javascript knowledge. 

Overall Grade: weak thumbs up
