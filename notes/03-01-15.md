###Discussion HighLights:
This meeting was a way for us to discuss who was going to write up each
section of the functional specification document, and then we came up with ideas
about the layout of the website. We talked about what pages we should have and the
content that should go onto those pages.
###Tasks:
Matthew Lydigsen: Is working on the flow chart and the non-goals sections.
Jake Bernstein: Is working on the overview section and the open-issues section.
Shaoxi Ma: Is working on the slide show. 
Raymond Zhu: Is working on the scenarios section.
Lucas Meira: Is working on the screen-by-screen section.
Michael Markman: Is working on the Team Organization section.
###Issues:
We had a few disputes about the overall layout of the site. We had trouble deciding
the exact content we wanted to put on each page and how the page should look. 
By the end of the meetig we decided on a general layout that made everyone happy 
and the more specific details will be determined further down the road.
