###Participants:
Matthew Lydigsen, Shaoxi Ma, Lucas Meira, Raymond Zhu, and Jake Bernstein
###Discussion HighLights:
This meeting was a progress update to see how well everyone was doing in their
individual sections. We went into further detail about how the backend, 
routing, and frontend should all fit together and went into great detail on 
what each page should look like so that everyone knew how the data was going
to be passed back and forth. We changed roles slightly to fit our time
requirements. 
###Tasks:
Matthew Lydigsen: Is working on getting mongodb working and helping out with
routing. Full Stack Developer

###Issues:
Our frontend developers weren't fully clear on what data they were recieving
and what data they should be sending back but this meeting cleared up those 
issues.
