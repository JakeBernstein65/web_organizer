###Discussion HighLights:
This meeting was for us to go over the layout of our code and how everything
will be set up. We decided on which routes we will need, what html files we will
need and what databases will be required. In addition, we decided to stick
with the roles we decided upon earlier in the semester for who is coding what
part of the website, although roles may change as coding commences. We also
decided upon the layout for our techincal design document for assignment 4.
